We never want to add passwords, API Keys, Database information, or any other sensitive information directly to our code that others will be able to see. Instead, we want to store these away in Environment Variables. Python-DotEnv simplifies this process and makes it simple to do. Let's get started...\\ndotenv\\nprogramming\\npython\\nIn this video, we'll be learning how I set up my development environments from scratch. I use scripts and dotfiles that I have saved on my Github page to make this process quick and easy. These scripts setup my terminal, VS Code, Sublime Text, and more. If you've ever wanted to know how I have my development environment set up or how I configure my settings, this video is for you.

We will learn how to create an API Key and connect to the YouTube API using Python. This will allow us to get public information from YouTube and do some analysis. In later videos, I will show how I use this API to grab useful information that might not be easily found on YouTube's site directly. Let's get started...\\napi\\npython\\nyoutube\\nyoutubeapi\\nIn this Python Programming Tutorial, we'll be learning how to use the Patreon API and the Pillow library to automate the creation of images. I'm specifically using this to add credits to the end of my videos to thank my supporters. This video will focus on Patreon supporters specifically, but in the next video, we will see how to use the YouTube API to do the same thing with YouTube Members. Let's get started...\\napi\\nautomation\\npatreon\\npillow\\npython\\nHi Everyone!\\nI really appreciate all of the support you all have shown me on Patreon and have been thinking of some different rewards and perks to show my appreciation. So today I added two more rewards tiers...\\nOne perk I added for supporters is early access to my videos. This will be available to those who support $3 or more per month. When I post new videos, you will have access to the videos for several days before the videos are available to the public. The links to the videos will be posted both on YouTube and Patreon for supporters.\\nThe second perk I added is having your names listed at the end of each of my videos in the form of credits. This will be available to those who support $5 or more per month. I'm actually working on a video right that should be released in a couple of days where you'll be able to see this in action. If you would like to see your names credited at the end of each video then be sure you have your rewards turned on so I know to add you.\\nI know this isn't much, but I just wanted to let you all know how much I appreciate your support and to let you know that I wouldn't be able to make these videos freely available to everyone without you. So thank you so much!\\nCorey\\n8\\nIn this Python Programming video, we will be learning how to load and save data using multiple different sources. We will learn how to read/write data to CSV, JSON, Excel, SQL, and more. This covers the vast majority of formats you'll see in the data science field and will be extremely useful to know.

So today I added two more rewards tiers...\\nOne perk I added for supporters is early access to my videos. This will be available to those who support $3 or more per month. When I post new videos, you will have access to the videos for several days before the videos are available to the public. The links to the videos will be posted both on YouTube and Patreon for supporters.\\nThe second perk I added is having your names listed at the end of each of my videos in the form of credits. This will be available to those who support $5 or more per month. I'm actually working on a video right that should be released in a couple of days where you'll be able to see this in action. If you would like to see your names credited at the end of each video then be sure you have your rewards turned on so I know to add you.\\nI know this isn't much, but I just wanted to let you all know how much I appreciate your support and to let you know that I wouldn't be able to make these videos freely available to everyone without you.

Instead, we want to store these away in Environment Variables. Python-DotEnv simplifies this process and makes it simple to do. Let's get started...\\ndotenv\\nprogramming\\npython\\nIn this video, we'll be learning how I set up my development environments from scratch. I use scripts and dotfiles that I have saved on my Github page to make this process quick and easy. These scripts setup my terminal, VS Code, Sublime Text, and more. If you've ever wanted to know how I have my development environment set up or how I configure my settings, this video is for you.

We will learn how to create an API Key and connect to the YouTube API using Python. This will allow us to get public information from YouTube and do some analysis. In later videos, I will show how I use this API to grab useful information that might not be easily found on YouTube's site directly. Let's get started...\\napi\\npython\\nyoutube\\nyoutubeapi\\nIn this Python Programming Tutorial, we'll be learning how to use the Patreon API and the Pillow library to automate the creation of images. I'm specifically using this to add credits to the end of my videos to thank my supporters. This video will focus on Patreon supporters specifically, but in the next video, we will see how to use the YouTube API to do the same thing with YouTube Members. Let's get started...\\napi\\nautomation\\npatreon\\npillow\\npython\\nHi Everyone!\\nI really appreciate all of the support you all have shown me on Patreon and have been thinking of some different rewards and perks to show my appreciation. So today I added two more rewards tiers...\\nOne perk I added for supporters is early access to my videos. This will be available to those who support $3 or more per month. When I post new videos, you will have access to the videos for several days before the videos are available to the public. The links to the videos will be posted both on YouTube and Patreon for supporters.\\nThe second perk I added is having your names listed at the end of each of my videos in the form of credits. This will be available to those who support $5 or more per month. I'm actually working on a video right that should be released in a couple of days where you'll be able to see this in action. If you would like to see your names credited at the end of each video then be sure you have your rewards turned on so I know to add you.\\nI know this isn't much, but I just wanted to let you all know how much I appreciate your support and to let you know that I wouldn't be able to make these videos freely available to everyone without you. So thank you so much!\\nCorey\\n8\\nIn this Python Programming video, we will be learning how to load and save data using multiple different sources. We will learn how to read/write data to CSV, JSON, Excel, SQL, and more. This covers the vast majority of formats you'll see in the data science field and will be extremely useful to know. Let's get started...\\nexcel\\njson\\npandas\\npython\\nsql\\nThanks for joining me on the live stream the other day, everyone. If you enjoyed this format then I can do more of this. But if not, don't worry. The channel will always be mostly tutorials. Here's the stream for anyone who missed it...\\nama\\ncorey schafer\\nlive stream\\npython\\nq&amp;a\\n1\\nIn this Python Programming video, we will be learning several different concepts about working with DateTimes and Time Series data in Pandas. We will learn how to convert values to datetimes, how to filter by dates, how to resample our dates to do some more in-depth analysis, and more. Let's get started...\\ndata analysis\\ndata science\\npandas\\npython\\ntime series\\n1\\nIn this Python Programming video, we will be learning how to clean our data. We will be learning how to handle remove missing values, fill missing values, cast datatypes, and more. This is an essential skill in Pandas because we will frequently need to modify our data to our needs. Let's get started...\\ndata science\\npandas\\npython\\n1\\nIn this Python Programming video, we will be learning how to group and aggregate our data. This will allow us to explore our data in ways we have not yet done in this series. We will be able to answer questions such as: \"What is the most popular social media site for each country?\" We will be using the groupby method, and also some aggregate functions such as mean, median, value_counts, etc. Let's get started...\\naggregate functions\\ngroupby\\npandas\\npython\\nIn this Python Programming video, we will be learning how to sort our data. We will learn how to sort single columns, sort multiple columns, and view the largest and smallest values in a DataFrame. Let's get started...\\npandas\\npython\\nsorting\\nIn this Python Programming video, we will be learning how to add and remove rows and columns from dataframes using the append and drop methods. We will also see how we can create new columns by combining elements from existing ones. Let's get started...\\npandas\\npython\\nIn this Python Programming video, we will be learning how to modify the data within our DataFrames. We will use some of the filtering techniques we learned in the last video to update values conditionally, and we will also be learning how to use the apply, map, and applymap method. Let's get started...\\npandas\\npython\\nIn this Python Programming video, we will be learning how to write conditionals in or to filter our data within our Pandas dataframes. This is a fundamental skill to have when using Pandas because it is one of the first things most people do when starting a new Pandas project. Let's get started...\\ndata science\\nfiltering\\npandas\\npython\\n1\\nIn this Python Programming video, we will be learning about the Pandas index. Indexes allow us to label our rows so that we can access them more easily. We'll learn how to set, reset, and use indexes properly.

Let's get started...\\napi\\nautomation\\npatreon\\npillow\\npython\\nHi Everyone!\\nI really appreciate all of the support you all have shown me on Patreon and have been thinking of some different rewards and perks to show my appreciation. So today I added two more rewards tiers...\\nOne perk I added for supporters is early access to my videos. This will be available to those who support $3 or more per month. When I post new videos, you will have access to the videos for several days before the videos are available to the public. The links to the videos will be posted both on YouTube and Patreon for supporters.\\nThe second perk I added is having your names listed at the end of each of my videos in the form of credits. This will be available to those who support $5 or more per month. I'm actually working on a video right that should be released in a couple of days where you'll be able to see this in action. If you would like to see your names credited at the end of each video then be sure you have your rewards turned on so I know to add you.\\nI know this isn't much, but I just wanted to let you all know how much I appreciate your support and to let you know that I wouldn't be able to make these videos freely available to everyone without you. So thank you so much!\\nCorey\\n8\\nIn this Python Programming video, we will be learning how to load and save data using multiple different sources.
